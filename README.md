## 💡 Aim

To develop an energy-efficient, analog soil moisture detection system that visually indicates soil conditions for agricultural and gardening applications.

---

## 🛠 Components Used

- LM358 Dual Op-Amp IC  
- 7805 Voltage Regulator  
- Moisture Probes  
- Red & Green LEDs  
- Resistors, Capacitors  
- 9V Battery, Breadboard, Wires

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle

- The **LM358** acts as a comparator.
- Probes detect soil resistance:
  - **Dry soil** → High resistance → Green LED OFF  
  - **Moist soil** → Low resistance → Green LED ON
- A 7805 regulator converts 9V to stable 5V for the circuit.
- A red LED shows power status; the green LED indicates moisture presence.
